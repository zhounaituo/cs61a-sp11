; Problem 1 (What will Scheme print?).
; What will Scheme print in response to the following 
; expressions? If an expression produces an error message, you 
; may just say “error”; you don't have to provide the exact text 
; of the message. If the value of an expression is a procedure, 
; just say “procedure”; you don't have to show the form in which 
; Scheme prints procedures.

(every - (keep number? '(the 1 after 909))) 
; (-1 -909) 

((lambda (a b) ((if (< b a) + *) b a)) 4 6)
; 24

(word (first '(cat)) (butlast 'dog)) 
; catdo

; What will Scheme print in response to the following 
; expressions? If an expression produces an error message, you 
; may just write “error”; you don't have to provide the exact 
; text of the message. Also, draw a box and pointer diagram for 
; the value produced by each expression.

(cons (list 1 2) (cons 3 4))
; ((1 2) 3 . 4)

(let ((p (list 4 5)))
    (cons (cdr p) (cddr p)) )
; ((5))

(cadadr '((a (b) c) (d (e) f) (g (h) i)))
; (e)


; Problem 2 (Orders of growth).
; (a) Indicate the order of growth in time of foo below:
(define (foo n)
    (if (< n 2)
        1
        (+ (baz (- n 1))
           (baz (- n 2)) ) ))
(define (baz n)
    (+ n (- n 1)) )

; ~Θ(n)~
; FOO is Theta(1)

; (b) Indicate the order of growth in time of garply below:
(define (garply n)
    (if (= n 0)
        0
        (+ (factorial n) (garply (- n 1)))))
(define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 0) 
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

;;;; GARPLY is Theta(n^2).


; Problem 3 (Normal and applicative order).
; Imagine that there is a primitive procedure called counter, 
; with no arguments, that returns 1 the first time you call it, 
; 2 the second time, and so on. (The multiplication procedure *, 
; used below, is also primitive.)

; Supposing that counter hasn't been called until now, what is 
; the value of the expression

; (* (counter) (counter))

; under applicative order? 2
; under normal order? ~1~ 2


; Problem 4 (Iterative and recursive processes) 
; One or more of the following procedures generates an iterative 
; process. Circle them. Don't circle the ones that generate a 
; recursive process.

; iterative
(define (butfirst-n num stuff)
    (if (= num 0)
        stuff
        (butfirst-n (- num 1) (bf stuff))))

; iterative
(define (member? thing stuff)
    (cond ((empty? stuff) #f)
          ((equal? thing (first stuff)) #t)
          (else (member? thing (bf stuff)))))

; recursive
(define (addup nums)
    (if (empty? nums)
        0
        (+ (first nums)
           (addup (bf nums)))))
        
; Problem 5 (Recursive procedures).
; Write a function SYLLABLES that takes a word as argument and 
; returns the number of syllables in the word. For our purposes, 
; the number of syllables is equal to the number of vowels, 
; except that consecutive vowels only count as one syllable:

; > (syllables 'banana)
; 3

; > (syllables 'aardvark)
; 2

; > (syllables 'cloud)
; 1

; (In real life there are additional complications, like Y being 
; a vowel sometimes, and silent Es not adding a syllable, but 
; ignore these problems.) Hint: You may find it useful to write 
; a function that chops off consecutive vowels from the 
; beginning of a word.

; You may assume the following definition of vowel?:

(define (vowel? letter)
    (member? letter '(a e i o u)))

(define (rec fx letter)
    (if (< (len letter) 2)
        letter
        (word (fx (first letter) (first (bf letter)))
              (rec fx (bf letter)))))

(define (len letter)
    (if (empty? letter)
        0
        (+ 1 (len (bf letter)))))

(define (countif fx letter)
    (if (empty? letter)
        0
        (+ (if (fx (first letter)) 1 0)
           (countif fx (bf letter)))))

(define (syllables letter)
    (define conditional ; Delete the redundant vowel letters.
        (lambda (p n) (if (and (vowel? p) (vowel? n))
                          ""
                          p)))
    (countif vowel? (rec conditional letter)))

; Problem 6 (Higher order functions).
; For homework you wrote a procedure ordered? that takes a 
; sentence of numbers as its argument, returning #t if the 
; numbers are in ascending order. You used the primitive 
; predicate < to compare the first number with the second.

; It’s possible to ask about the ordering of sentences of things 
; other than numbers, provided we have some way of asking 
; whether one thing comes before another. For example, we can 
; ask whether the words in a sentence are in alphabetical order, 
; or whether the lengths of the words are in increasing order.

; (Part a) Write a procedure in-order? that takes two arguments: 
; first, a predicate function of two arguments that returns #t 
; if its first argument comes before its second; second, a 
; sentence. Your procedure should return #t if the sentence is 
; in increasing order according to the given predicate. Examples:

(define (shorter? a b)
    (< (count a) (count b)) )
; 
; > (in-order? shorter? '(i saw them standing together))
; #t ;#f 
; 
; > (in-order? shorter? '(i saw her standing there))
; #f
; 
; > (in-order? < '(2 3 5 5 8 13))
; #f
; 
; > (in-order? <= '(2 3 5 5 8 13))
; #t
; 
; > (in-order? > '(23 14 7 5 2))
; #t

(define (in-order? fx sent)
    (if (< (count sent) 2)
        #t
        (and (fx (first sent) (first (bf sent)))
             (in-order? fx (bf sent)))))

; (Part b) Write a procedure order-checker that takes as its 
; only argument a predicate function of two arguments. Your 
; procedure should return a predicate function with one 
; argument, a sentence; this returned procedure should return #t 
; if the sentence is in ascending order according to the 
; predicate argument. For example:


(define (order-checker fx)
    (lambda (sent) (in-order? fx sent)))

(define length-ordered? (order-checker shorter?))

; > (length-ordered? '(i saw them standing together))
; #t
; 
; > (length-ordered? '(i saw her standing there))
; #f
; 
; > ((order-checker <) '(2 3 5 5 8 13))
; #f
; 
; > ((order-checker <=) '(2 3 5 5 8 13))
; #t
; 
; > ((order-checker >) '(23 14 7 5 2))
; #t

; Problem 7 (Data abstraction).
; We want to write a program that uses the time of day as an 
; abstract data type. We’ll represent times internally as a list 
; of three elements, such as (11 23 am) for 11:23 am. For the 
; purposes of this problem, assume that the hour part is never 
; 12, so there’s never any special problems about noon and 
; midnight. The hour will be a number 1–11, the minute will be a 
; number 0–59, and the third element (which we’ll call the 
; category) must be the word am or the word pm. Here’s our 
; implementation:
(define (make-time hr mn cat) (list hr mn cat))
(define hour car)
(define minute cadr)
(define category caddr)

; (a) This is a good internal representation, but not a good 
; representation for the user of our program to see. Write a 
; function time-print-form that takes a time as its argument and 
; returns a word of the form 3:07pm.

(define (time-print-form time)
    (display (hour time))
    (display #\:)
    (display (format (minute time)))
    (display (category time))
    (newline))

(define (format num)
    (if (>= num 10) num (word '00 num)))

; (b) If we want to ask whether one time is before or after 
; another, it’s convenient to use the 24-hour representation in 
; which 3:47 pm has the form 1547. Write a procedure 24-hour 
; that takes a time as its argument and returns the number that 
; represents that time in 24-hour notation:

; > (24-hour (make-time 3 47 'pm))
; 1547

(define (24-hour time)
    (word (+ (hour time) 
             (if (equal? 'pm (category time)) 12 0))
          (minute time)))

; (c) Now we decide to change the internal representation of 
; times to be a number in 24-hour form. But we want the 
; constructor and selectors to have the same interface so that 
; programs using the abstract data type don’t have to change. 
; Rewrite the constructor and selectors to accomplish this.

(define (make-time time)
    (let ((h (bl (bl time)))
          (m (rt 2 time))
          (c (if (> (bl (bl time)) 12) 'pm 'am)))
        (list (if (> h 12) (- h 12) h) m c)))
        
(define (lf n s)
    (if (= n 0)
        s
        (lf (- n 1) (bl s))))
         
(define (rt n s)
    (if (= n 0)
        s
        (rt (- n 1) (bf s))))
